<p>There was an interesting problem I encountered in my microeconomics course. Suppose you are risk-averse and you have a friend who has an investment project. There is a <span class="math inline">\(50 \%\)</span> probability that the project succeeds and if it does, it will be valued at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> kr. Furthermore, let us suppose it is at least double your initial wealth ie. <span class="math inline">\(x \geq 2 \cdot w_0\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(w_0\)</span> is your initial wealth. The price to participate is <span class="math inline">\(\theta \cdot w_0\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\theta \in [0,1]\)</span> ie. it is some share of your initial wealth. Notably this means that whether it succeeds or not, you still have to pay that price. Should you participate? More precisely, for what <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> would you accept the gamble? The basic assumption is that you will choose the gamble that yields the highest expected value.</p>
<p>Since we are risk-averse, our preferences will be represented by a strictly concave Von-Neumann-Morgenstern utility function by a well-known theorem. One example of such a utility function is <span class="math inline">\(u(w) = \ln(w)\)</span>. Therefore, the expected value of doing nothing will be … As for the investment project, we can write it as the following gamble:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P \left( A=2 \, \middle| \, \dfrac{A^2}{B}&gt;4 \right)\]</span></p>
<p>and so the expected value for the investment project will be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
M = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{5}{6} &amp; \frac{1}{6} &amp; 0 \\
\frac{5}{6} &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{1}{6} \\
0 &amp; \frac{5}{6} &amp; \frac{1}{6}
\end{bmatrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>How does the expected value <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> for the investment project depend on <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(x = 2 \cdot w_0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(x \geq 2 \cdot w_0\)</span>? Furthermore, what value should <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> be such that you are indifferent between doing nothing and taking the gamble? And what is the optimal <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> (depending on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w_0\)</span>) that will yield the highest expected value? Ie. what is the ideal scenario in which you would participate despite being risk-averse?</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
  V_{\circ} &amp;= \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \\
  &amp;= 4 \pi \cdot K
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>This poem by Martin Luther King:</p>
<p>Fleecy locks, and black complexion<br />
Cannot forfeit nature’s claim.<br />
Skin may dinner, but affection<br />
Dwells in black and white the same.<br />
And if I were so tall as to reach the pole,<br />
And to grasp the ocean at a span,<br />
I must be measured by my soul.<br />
The mind is the standard of the man.</p>
